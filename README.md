Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains code and resources related to the "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" 3rd edition book by Aurélien Géron.

Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape

In this chapter, we introduce the basics of machine learning and discuss the various types of machine learning algorithms and their applications. 
(The code files can be found as USERNAME_day1.ipynb or USERNAME_1.ipynb)

Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

In this chapter, we walk through the process of building a machine learning project from start to finish, including data collection, data cleaning,
feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and model deployment

Chapter 3: Classification

In this chapter, we explore different types of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
We also discuss how to evaluate the performance of a classification model and how to tune its hyperparameters

(As we progress, I will upload the details about the chapters here for the quick review)
